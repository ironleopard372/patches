Subject: [PATCH 07/13] DO-NOT-UPSTREAM: Hide -Wconstant-conversion behind W=3

There are a few of these warnings sprinkled throughout the kernel and
there is some pushback on fixing them. Joe Perches suggested that this
be hidden behind W=3 like all of the other signed warnings. This is also
disabled in Chrome OS's 4.14 branch.
