Subject: [PATCH 06/10] DO-NOT-UPSTREAM: Disable -Wswitch

These warnings are related to use of the _IOC macro to define certain
values for switch statements which then overflow because the type is int
when it really should be unsigned int. There will need to be some
discussion about how to solve that in the scsi subsystem and until that
happens, this is just noise.
