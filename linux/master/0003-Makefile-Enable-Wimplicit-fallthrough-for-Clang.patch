Subject: [PATCH 03/18] Makefile: Enable -Wimplicit-fallthrough for Clang

With the recent fixes for fallthrough warnings, it is now possible to
enable -Wimplicit-fallthrough for Clang.

Special thanks to Nathan Chancellor who fixed the Clang bug[1][2]
that put the application of this patch to a halt, temporarily. This
bugfix only appears in Clang 14.0.0, so older versions still contain
the bug and -Wimplicit-fallthrough won't be enabled for them, for
now.

This concludes a long journey and now we are finally getting rid
of the unintentional fallthrough bug-class in the kernel, entirely. :)
