Subject: [PATCH 03/18] futex: mark futex_detect_cmpxchg() as 'noinline'

On 32-bit ARM, I got a link failure in futex_init() when building
with clang in some random configurations:

kernel/futex.o:(.text.fixup+0x5c): relocation truncated to fit: R_ARM_JUMP24 against `.init.text'

As far as I can tell, the problem is that a branch is over 16MB
apart in those configurations, but only if it branches back to
the init text.

Marking the futex_detect_cmpxchg() function as noinline and
not __init avoids the problem for me.
