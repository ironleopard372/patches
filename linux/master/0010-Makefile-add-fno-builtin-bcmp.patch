Subject: [PATCH 10/22] Makefile: add -fno-builtin-bcmp

The issue with using `-fno-builtin-*` flags was that they were not
retained during an LTO link with LLVM.  This was fixed in clang-11 by
https://reviews.llvm.org/D71193
(0508c994f0b14144041f2cfd3ba9f9a80f03de08), which is also the minimum
supported version of clang for LTO.  Use `-fno-builtin-bcmp` instead.

With this applid, we can cleanly revert
commit 5f074f3e192f ("lib/string.c: implement a basic bcmp")
