Subject: [PATCH 26/26] remoteproc/omap: Fix set_load call in
 omap_rproc_request_timer

When building arm allyesconfig:

drivers/remoteproc/omap_remoteproc.c:174:44: error: too many arguments
to function call, expected 2, have 3
        timer->timer_ops->set_load(timer->odt, 0, 0);
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                ^
1 error generated.

This is due to commit 02e6d546e3bd ("clocksource/drivers/timer-ti-dm:
Enable autoreload in set_pwm") in the clockevents tree interacting with
commit e28edc571925 ("remoteproc/omap: Request a timer(s) for remoteproc
usage") from the rpmsg tree.

This should have been fixed during the merge of the remoteproc tree
since it happened after the clockevents tree merge; however, it does not
look like my email was noticed by either maintainer and I did not pay
attention when the pull was sent since I was on CC.

Fixes: c6570114316f ("Merge tag 'rproc-v5.7' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/andersson/remoteproc")
