Subject: [PATCH 3/3] arm64: Don't unconditionally add -Wno-psabi to
 KBUILD_CFLAGS

This is a GCC only option, which warns about ABI changes within GCC, so
unconditionally adding breaks Clang with tons of:

warning: unknown warning option '-Wno-psabi' [-Wunknown-warning-option]

and link time failures:

ld.lld: error: undefined symbol: __efistub___stack_chk_guard
>>> referenced by arm-stub.c:73
(/home/nathan/cbl/linux/drivers/firmware/efi/libstub/arm-stub.c:73)
>>>               arm-stub.stub.o:(__efistub_install_memreserve_table)
in archive ./drivers/firmware/efi/libstub/lib.a

I suspect the link time failure comes from some flags not being added
via cc-option, which will always fail when an unknown flag is
unconditionally added to KBUILD_CFLAGS because -Werror is added after
commit c3f0d0bc5b01 ("kbuild, LLVMLinux: Add -Werror to cc-option to
support clang").

$ echo "int main() { return 0; }" | clang -Wno-psabi -o /dev/null -x c -
warning: unknown warning option '-Wno-psabi' [-Wunknown-warning-option]
1 warning generated.

$ echo $?
0

$ echo "int main() { return 0; }" | clang -Werror -Wno-psabi -o /dev/null -x c -
error: unknown warning option '-Wno-psabi' [-Werror,-Wunknown-warning-option]

$ echo $?
1

This side effect is user visible (aside from the inordinate amount of
-Wunknown-warning-option and build failure), as some warnings that are
normally disabled like -Waddress-of-packed-member or
-Wunused-const-variable show up.

Use cc-disable-warning so that it gets disabled for GCC and does nothing
for Clang.
