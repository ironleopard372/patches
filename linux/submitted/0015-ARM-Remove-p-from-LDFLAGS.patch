Subject: [PATCH 15/15] ARM: Remove '-p' from LDFLAGS

This option is not supported by lld:

    ld.lld: error: unknown argument: -p

This has been a no-op in binutils since 2004 (see commit dea514f51da1 in
that tree). Given that the lowest officially supported of binutils for
the kernel is 2.20, which was released in 2009, nobody needs this flag
around so just remove it. Commit 1a381d4a0a9a ("arm64: remove no-op -p
linker flag") did the same for arm64.
