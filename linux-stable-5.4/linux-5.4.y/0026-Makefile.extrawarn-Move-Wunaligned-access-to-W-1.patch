Subject: [PATCH 26/30] Makefile.extrawarn: Move -Wunaligned-access to W=1

-Wunaligned-access is a new warning in clang that is default enabled for
arm and arm64 under certain circumstances within the clang frontend (see
LLVM commit below). On v5.17-rc2, an ARCH=arm allmodconfig build shows
1284 total/70 unique instances of this warning (most of the instances
are in header files), which is quite noisy.

To keep a normal build green through CONFIG_WERROR, only show this
warning with W=1, which will allow automated build systems to catch new
instances of the warning so that the total number can be driven down to
zero eventually since catching unaligned accesses at compile time would
be generally useful.
