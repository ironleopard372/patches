Subject: [PATCH 02/14] Revert "mtd: spinand: Fix OOB read"

This reverts stable commit baad618d078c857f99cc286ea249e9629159901f.

This commit is adding lines to spinand_write_to_cache_op, wheras the upstream
commit 868cbe2a6dcee451bd8f87cbbb2a73cf463b57e5 that this was supposed to
backport was touching spinand_read_from_cache_op.
It causes a crash on writing OOB data by attempting to write to read-only
kernel memory.
