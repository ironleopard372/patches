Subject: [PATCH 18/24] kbuild: Enable -Wtautological-compare

Currently, we disable -Wtautological-compare, which in turn disables a
bunch of more specific tautological comparison warnings that are useful
for the kernel (see the Twitter link below).

-Wtautological-constant-out-of-range-compare is kept disabled because
there are places in the kernel where a constant can change based on the
kernel configuration; these are not fixed in a clean/concise way and
they are harmless so this warning is kept disabled.
